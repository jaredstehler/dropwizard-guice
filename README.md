Dropwizard-Guice
================

This project demonstrates a simple method for integrating Guice with Dropwizard. It uses classpath scanning courtesy of the Reflections project to discover resources to install into the dropwizard environment upon service start.

### Usage

It's simple to use; simple extend from AutoConfigService<? extends Configuration> rather than Service, and optionally override createInjector to provide modules into the guice injector. Now you'll be able to use javax.inject.Inject annotations throughout your project for dependency injection!

See the test classes located within src/test/java/com/fiestacabin/dropwizard/guice/test for an example.

This library is available on the public maven repository:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.fiestacabin.dropwizard.guice</groupId>
        <artifactId>dropwizard-guice</artifactId>
        <version>0.7.1</version>
    </dependency>
